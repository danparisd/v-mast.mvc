Carefully absorb and consider what is being said to understand the full content of the passage.</li><li>Pause, reflect, and re-read as necessary.</li><li>Spend no more than 12 minutes on this activity.</li>",

    "chunking" => "Chunk",
    "chunking_desc" => "<li><b>PURPOSE:</b> to divide the text into manageable portions for translation</li><li>Click on 2-5 verses and then “make chunk” for grouping into chunks to prepare for blind draft.</li><li>Chunk the entire chapter, focusing on similar topics and logical breaks in thought.</li><li>Spend no more than 5 minutes on this exercise</li>",

Just translate what you remember.</li><li>Do not be concerned about marking verses. This will be done in the final step</li><li>One of the foundational characteristics of good translation is the naturalness of language. The blind draft captures this and allows the brain/short term memory to push forward into pushing the most natural text out quickly. This is not meant to be perfectly accurate text (the next four steps will work toward that), this is meant to put the foundation of naturalness, which if absent, leads to extended error and long periods of foundational error correction.</li><li>Spend no more than 10-12 minutes on this exercise per chunk</li>",

As your partner makes their comments, adjust your translation.</li><li>Make sure that the words used match the chosen literary level.</li><li>Spend no more than 60 minutes with your partner on this exercise. Do not waste time on disagreements. In such cases, leave the translated text as it is, record a note on the appropriate chunk, and move on.</li>",
