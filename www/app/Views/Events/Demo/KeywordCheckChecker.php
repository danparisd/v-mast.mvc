There are different meanings for "love" which some languages may express using different words:1. The kind of love that comes from God is focused on the good of others, even when it doesn't benefit oneself. This kind of love cares for others, no matter what they do. God himself is love and is the source of true love.<ul><li>Jesus showed this kind of love by sacrificing his life in order to rescue us from sin and death. He also taught his followers to love others sacrificially.</li><li>When people love others with this kind of love, it involves actions that show that someone is thinking of what will cause the other person to thrive. This kind of love especially includes forgiving others.</li><li>In the ULB, the word "love" refers to this kind of sacrificial love, unless a Translation Note indicates a different meaning.</li></ul>2. Another word in the New Testament refers to brotherly love or love for a friend or family member.<ul><li>This term refers to natural human love between friends or relatives.</li><li>It can also be used in such contexts as, "They love to sit in the most important seats at a banquet."

In the figurative expression, "Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated," the term "loved" refers to God's choosing of Jacob to be in a covenant relationship with him. This could also be translated as "chosen." Although Esau was also blessed by God, he wasn't given the privilege of being in the covenant. The term "hated" is used figuratively here to mean "rejected" or "not chosen."<h2>Translation Suggestions</h2><ul><li>Unless indicated otherwise in a Translation Note, the word "love" in the ULB refers to the kind of sacrificial love that comes from God.</li><li>Some languages may have a special word for the kind of unselfish, sacrificial love that God has.

Some languages might translate this with a word or phrase that means, "like very much" or "care for" or "have strong affection for."</li><li>In contexts where the word "love" is used to express a strong preference for something, this could be translated by "strongly prefer" or "like very much" or "greatly desire."</li><li>Some languages may also have a separate word that refers to romantic or sexual love between a husband and wife.</li><li>Many languages must express "love" as an action.

Sometimes a trap can be a deep hole that has been made in order to get something to fall into it.</li><li>Usually the snare or trap is hidden so that its prey is taken by surprise. </li><li>The phrase "set a trap" means to get a trap ready to capture something.</li><li>To "fall into a trap" refers to falling into a deep hole or pit that was dug and hidden in order to catch an animal.</li><li>When used figuratively, being caught in a trap or snare is compared to how a person can suddenly become ensnared in a sin in the same way that an animal gets captured by a physical snare or trap.</li><li>Just as an animal is endangered and hurt by being in a trap, so a person caught in the trap of sin is being harmed by that sin and needs to be set free.</li></ul></div>
