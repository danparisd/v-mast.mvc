                            <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Remember Jesus Christ, from David's seed, who was raised from the dead ones.

But the word of God is not chained.                                                                                                        <strong><sup>10</sup></strong>Therefore I endure all things for those who are chosen, so that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.                                                                                                        <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>This saying is trustworthy:   "If we have died with him, we will also live with him.                                                                                                         <strong><sup>12</sup></strong>If we endure, we will also reign with him.

                            <strong><sup>21</sup></strong>If someone cleans himself from dishonorable use, he is an honorable container.

                            <strong><sup>8</sup></strong>Remember Jesus Christ, from David's seed, who was raised from the dead ones. This is according to my gospel message,                                                                                                        <strong><sup>9</sup></strong>for which I am suffering to the point of being chained as a criminal.
