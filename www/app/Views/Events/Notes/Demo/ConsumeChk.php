                    <p><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> When he was meeting together with them, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, about which, he said, "You heard from me</p>
                    <p><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> that John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit in a few days." </p>

                    <p><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> When they were assembled together they asked him, "Lord, is this the time you will restore the kingdom to Israel?"</p>
                    <p><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> He said to them, "It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father has determined by his own authority.</p>
                    <p><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> But you will receive power, when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you will be my witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."</p>

                    <p><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> When the Lord Jesus had said these things, as they were looking up, he was raised up, and a cloud hid him from their eyes.</p>
                    <p><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> While they were looking intensely to heaven as he went, suddenly, two men stood by them in white clothing.</p>
                    <p><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> They said, "You men of Galilee, why do you stand here looking into heaven? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven, will return in the same manner as you saw him going into heaven."</p>

                    <p><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> When they arrived, they went up into the upper chamber, where they were staying. They were Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James.</p>
                    <p><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> They were all united as one, as they diligently continued in prayer. Included were the women, Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</p>

                    <p><strong><sup>23</sup></strong> They put forward two men, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also named Justus, and Matthias.</p>

                    <p><strong><sup>24</sup></strong> They prayed and said, "You, Lord, know the hearts of all people, so reveal which of these two is the one whom you have chosen</p>
                    <p><strong><sup>25</sup></strong> to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned away to go to his own place."</p>
